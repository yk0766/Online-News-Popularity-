# Online News Popularity Prediction
## Problem statement
The marketing team of Mashable is responsible identifying popular articles and accordingly sell ads on these articles to incur large profits. Currently the team uses heuristics to predict articles popularity and has flat rate for ads irrespective of the popularity. The team lacks a framework to identify article popularity based on historical data of articles published on the website.
